  <h1> Programming with JavaScript</h1>

   <h2>What's it like Programming JavaScript?</h2>

   <h3> <p> Looking through the first article of how to program Java Script, there are a lot of
    operations that you must understand. There are many of them and most of these operations are 
    algebra based formulas. It's a lot to process at the moment, but I'm sure these are just examples as of
    how you can use Javascript when performing different tasks. Two of those operations that I can remember 
    are arithmetic and assignment operation, though the article has many more to present when it comes to these
    expressions. </p>
    
    <p> With these expressions, you can understand the roots of how the programming works. Although, as a rookie into this
    type of programming language, it may still be complex. I'd say that the values such as "||" and "**" may be difficult
    to remember to use. So overall, JavaScript is mostly made up Functions, Variables, and Expressions, which will be used to
    enhance a website to function properly. This will be a very interesting experience using this language!</p> </h3>
